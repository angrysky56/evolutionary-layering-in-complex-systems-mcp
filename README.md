# Evolutionary Layering in Complex Systems (ELCS) Framework
## Dynamic Emergence Networks for Multi-Scale Complex Systems

I'll test the ELCS framework tools to see if they're working properly and evaluate their usefulness. Let me start by checking the framework status and then run through a comprehensive test of the available tools. Great! The framework is responding. Now let me test the core functionality by creating a Dynamic Emergence Network first: Excellent! Now let me create a swarm simulation with this network: Perfect! The swarm is created with 12 agents. Now let me run a simulation to test the actual swarm intelligence: Fantastic! The simulation is working. I can see agents are dynamically changing roles throughout the cycles and we have detailed performance metrics. Now let me test the emergence pattern detection: Great! Now let me test the collective decision-making functionality: Now let me test parameter optimization: Now let me check the final framework status to see everything that's been created: Let me also test with a more complex environment to see if we can trigger emergence behaviors: ## ELCS Framework Testing Results
